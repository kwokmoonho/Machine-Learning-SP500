# Machine-Learning-SP500

The objective of this project is aimed at using python and different machine learning algorithms(LSTM, KNN, Linear Regression) to conduct predictions on the S&P500 index. This problem is interesting because it can compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms when it applies to the prediction of the S&P500 index. At the end of the project, it should bee able to conclude which algorithms are better for the prediction of the S&P500 index.
All data are obtained from Yahoo Finance S&P500 index. There are 8850 instances in the data set from the period 2/1/1985 to 3/13/2020. The reason this period is chosen because it contains at least three economic recession in USA history. The data type of this data only contains Date, Numeric data type.
The project experienced three different machine learning algorithms which are LSTM, KNN, and linear regression. LSTM obviously has a better result than linear regression, and linear regression has a better result than KNN.
